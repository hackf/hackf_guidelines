Windsor Hackforge Software Development Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------

### Coding Practices
- Don't be too clever; readability is #1
- Check available libraries for a solution to your problem
- If you must do something weird, explain with a comment
- If the code does something obvious, please do NOT explain with a comment

### Style Guides
- Tab width should be 4 spaces unless otherwise noted in project-specific guidelines
- Front-end web development guidelines: http://isobar-idev.github.io/code-standards/
- Python should follow PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

### Contributing - Fork & Pull Request
- Fork the repository, make your changes in your own github repo, and submit a
  Pull Request
- Clearly label your PR with a short title that describes the issue you are
  addressing or the feature you are implementing
- The body of your PR description should include a concise, bullet-point list of
  your changes
- When a PR has been given the "thumbs up" by at least two other developers, 
  a lead developer will merge your commits
- Please do not merge your own PRs, even if you are a lead developer
